Reading Exercise 4.4 & 4.5

The relevant input in the max method is the int[] arr because its length directly decides the number of iterations of the for loop. Suppose the length of the array is n.

Now we want to count the number of accesses to the array. Notice that the initialization of ret and the if statement in each iteration of the for loop are fixed, so there are already n array operations. Then we look into ret=arr[i], which may or may not happen.

The worst scenario is that the array is arranged in the ascending order, so there are n-1 array operations. The best case is that the maximum shows up as arr[0], so there will be 0 additional array operation. Hence the average performance is (n-1)/2.

Adding the basic n operations, we have the following models of array operations:
T_best = n
T_worst = 2n-1
T_avg = 1.5n-0.5

Therefore, all three models have O(n).
